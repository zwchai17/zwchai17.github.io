I am currently working at [Zhipu AI](https://z.ai/chat) (since Feb. 2025), where I co-lead the **pre-training data pipeline** specifically for high-quality **math** and **science** data. My work involves end-to-end data processing—including cleaning, parsing, synthesis, and evaluation—for the GLM model family (spanning **GLM-4.5** through **GLM-5**). I also contributed to **reasoning post-training** (SFT & RL), where the GLM series achieve open-source [SOTA performance](https://artificialanalysis.ai/).


Before joining Zhipu AI, I was a Research Intern at [ByteDance Seed](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/) (Nov. 2023 - Feb. 2025) working on **multi-agent LLM systems**. I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) advised by [Prof. Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/), where I also received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering in 2021.

I am currently open to **industrial opportunities in LLM teams**. If you have suitable positions, please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:zwchai@zju.edu.cn) or [WeChat]({{ '/assets/img/wechat.jpg' | relative_url }}).
